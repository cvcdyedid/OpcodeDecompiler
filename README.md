OpcodeDecompiler
================

This tool was developed by the Zorg Team for the 2012 Codeguru Xtreme competiton.
Feel free to use it and develop it, but please share everyone with your developments.
This tool is used to decompile bytes to their Assembler text, to compile CoreWars8086 players, decompile them and more.

Notes:
- Write the bytes with 0x at the beginning. E.g.: 0xa5 will be decompiled to movsw.
- Always check that there're no errors in the log after the compilation.
- You can drag and drop a player on the group box of the decompilation. The app will decompile it.
- You need to have NASM at the right place.
- At the end of the decompiled file there'll be a list of bytes and their locations. These bytes are "special" bytes.
  They're unique in the player. This is good for int 0x87 attacks.

Best regards & Good luck!
